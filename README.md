# STF: Segmentation-Tracking Framework

**STF** (Segmentation-Tracking Framework) is a comprehensive framework specifically designed for **tissue tracking** in **Endoscopic Videos**.

The project aims to provide a powerful toolset that integrates advanced **Image Segmentation** and **Object Tracking** techniques to enable precise and robust dynamic analysis of biological tissues and lesions in a clinical setting.

The complete user guide, including detailed operational instructions and a demonstration of how to use the demo, will be showcased in the near future. We are currently working hard on the final editing.
